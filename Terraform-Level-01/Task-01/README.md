# AWS Key Pair Creation with Terraform

## 📌 Task Description

The **Nautilus DevOps team** is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the **AWS cloud**. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

**Requirements:**
- Name of the key pair should be **`devops-kp`**
- Key pair type must be **`rsa`**
- The private key file should be saved under **`/home/bob/devops-kp.pem`**
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

To execute this task on the target system, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Working Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/bob/terraform
   ```

2. **Create the Configuration File:**
   Ensure `main.tf` is created in this directory with the appropriate Terraform configurations for the AWS Key Pair, Local File, and TLS Private Key.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
   Initialize the Terraform working directory to download the necessary providers.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Review the Execution Plan:**
   Check the planned changes before applying them.
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration:**
   Apply the changes to create the resources.
   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

6. **Verify the Private Key:**
   Check if the private key was successfully created with the correct permissions.
   ```bash
   ls -l /home/bob/xfusion-kp.pem
   ```
